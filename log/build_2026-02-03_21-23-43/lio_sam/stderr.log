CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:29 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0074" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable PCL_ROOT is set to:

    /usr

  For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
